# 507ex-utils
## Overview
The .507ex file format is pretty much a zip file but, with a little extra magic behind the scenes.
It allows you to easily turn your program into an app that you can share with the world!

## Runfile
The Runfile is a file that is required to be in any source directory that is being packed as a .507ex. It contains the shell command in order to run your app.
